    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      üëã I‚Äôm Nick Rotondo (<code>@rotondozer</code>), a full-stack software engineer with an obsession for efficient
      problem-solving and building impactful
      solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      ü§ì As self-taught musician and a self-taught programmer, what I love about both music and engineering is how they combine
      structure and creativity.
      They both invoke a similar thrill when I get taken into my work and let the ideas flow through my fingertips as the picture
      comes into focus. Math ü§ù Art.
    </p>
    <p>
      üí• I burst into a software career in 2017 after years of serving and bartending through seemingly endless brunch shifts,
      eventually managing a restaurant.
      Those years in customer service sharpened soft skills that translate seamlessly to software: leading teams, staying cool
      under fire, triaging chaotic
      situations, and soothing hot tempers <em>(üå∂Ô∏è seriously, some people should just eat at home!)</em>. The service industry
      taught me invaluable lessons in
      clear communication, effective prioritization, stress management, and persistence when the stakes are high.
    </p>
    <p>
      üè° Outside of building software and practicing music, I love spending time with my wife and our son. Parenthood‚Äîand my years
      as a long-time dog dad to
      Dahlia‚Äîhas profoundly shaped me, inspiring my dedication to crafting meaningful solutions. When fatherhood gives me a moment
      to spare, you‚Äôll often find
      me diving into DIY home or auto projects or getting lost in science and history documentaries <em>(which, let‚Äôs be honest,
      usually put my wife to sleep üòÑ)</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      üìà Over the years, I‚Äôve honed my skills in full-stack development, building scalable web apps with <strong>Ruby on
      Rails</strong>, <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>,
      and modern tools like <strong>Turbo</strong> and <strong>Stimulus.js</strong>. Early in my career, I focused on crafting
      modular, maintainable <strong>React</strong>
      codebases in <strong>TypeScript</strong>, delivering elegant client-side solutions to meet complex UI/UX challenges. Whether
      working on the front-end or back-end,
      I‚Äôm driven by a passion for building tools that solve real-world problems and delight users. Keep reading to dive deeper

    <h2>Professional Impact</h2>
    <p>
      At <a href="https://www.houseaccount.com">HouseAccount</a>, I joined as the first engineering hire and played a pivotal role
      in taking
      the company from concept to market. I helped build and launch a scalable <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> platform that
      achieved 99.9%
      uptime while processing millions of dollars in transactions. I worked closely with leadership to grow the engineering team,
      mentor new hires, and establish a collaborative, product-driven culture.
    </p>
    <p>
      At <a href="https://www.lightspeedhq.com">Upserve (now a part of Lightspeed)</a>, I combined my restaurant industry
      experience with
      software engineering to build POS technology tailored for restaurants and their employees. It was here that I became
      proficient in
      <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>TypeScript</strong>, developed high-performance front-end systems with <strong>React
      + React Native</strong>,
      and gained a passionate appreciation for leveraging <strong>Monads</strong> to create elegant, maintainable code. Mentoring
      engineers and
      leading projects were also core strengths at Upserve, where I helped foster team growth and collaboration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Together, these experiences have shaped my ability to lead impactful projects, mentor others, and create meaningful,
      user-driven solutions by connecting technical innovation with real-world challenges.

        A digital archive for my band, Honest Living, built with Elm. The project was more about learning the Elm programming
        language, and having
        <a href="https://www.honestlivingband.com" target="_blank">a site to visit to continue to share our music</a>
        was a nice by-product. Though the band no longer practices, this site preserves our music and remains a
        favorite for my wife‚Äîour biggest fan!

        An experimental project built with TypeScript, designed to use SumTypes and Monads (thanks to
        <a href="https://github.com/hojberg/sums-up" target="_blank"><code>sums-up</code></a> and
        <a href="https://github.com/hojberg/seidr" target="_blank"><code>seidr</code></a>).
        Potential applications include serving as an engine for a digital Settlers of Catan or as a companion tool for the
        physical game. This project reflects my love for combining technical exploration with creativity.
