    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m Nick Rotondo, a software engineer with a passion for solving problems and building impactful solutions. My journey into
      engineering started with a different kind of creativity—I spent years as a drummer and a restaurant manager before diving
      into software development.</p>
    <p>What I love about both music and engineering is how they combine structure and creativity. Over the past several years,
      I’ve honed my skills in full-stack development, focusing on tools like <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>,
      <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>, and <strong>Turbo</strong>. Parenthood and my time as a long-time dog
      dad to Dahlia have shaped who I am today, driving my dedication to creating solutions that matter.</p>

  <section id="impact">
    <h2>Professional Impact</h2>
    <p>At <strong>HouseAccount</strong>, I joined as the first engineering hire and played a pivotal role in taking the company
      from concept to market. I helped build and launch a scalable <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> platform that achieved 99.9%
      uptime while processing millions of dollars in transactions. I worked closely with leadership to grow the engineering team,
      mentor new hires, and establish a collaborative, product-driven culture.</p>
    <p>At <strong>Upserve</strong>, I combined my restaurant industry experience with software engineering to build POS technology
      tailored for restaurants and their employees. It was here that I became proficient in <strong>JavaScript</strong> and
      <strong>TypeScript</strong>, developed high-performance front-end systems with <strong>React</strong>, and gained a
      passionate appreciation for leveraging <strong>Monads</strong> to create elegant, maintainable code. Mentoring engineers and
      leading projects were also core strengths at Upserve, where I helped foster team growth and collaboration.</p>
    <p>Together, these experiences have shaped my ability to lead impactful projects, mentor others, and create meaningful,
      user-driven solutions by connecting technical innovation with real-world challenges.</p>
